# Any xlib / motif / CDE programming guidebooks PDF?

**Grok:**

Yes, several classic programming guides for **Xlib**, **Motif** (OSF/Motif), and **CDE** (Common Desktop Environment) are available as free PDFs online, thanks to archives, O'Reilly's open books, vendor docs, and university mirrors. These are older but still the definitive references for low-level X11/Motif/CDE programming.

Here are some direct, working PDF links (as of recent checks; they come from legitimate public archives like Internet Archive, O'Reilly open books, X.Org, and university sites):

**Xlib** (the core C library for X11):
- Xlib Programming Manual (O'Reilly, comprehensive tutorial style): https://www.niksula.hut.fi/~jkirma/books/xlib.pdf
- Official Xlib – C Language X Interface (X.Org spec/reference): https://www.x.org/docs/X11/xlib.pdf

**Motif** (the widget toolkit built on Xt/Xlib):
- Motif Programming Manual (O'Reilly Volume 6A, excellent practical guide with examples): https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/motif/vol6a/Vol6a.pdf
- HP's OSF/Motif Programmer's Guide (another solid intro): https://bitsavers.org/pdf/hp/9000_hpux/x11/98794-90005_OSF_Motif_Programmers_Guide_Sep89.pdf
- Motif Reference Manual for Motif 2.1 (detailed widget reference): https://www.ist.co.uk/motif/download/6B/6B_book.pdf

**CDE** (Common Desktop Environment, built on Motif):
- Solaris Common Desktop Environment: Programmer's Guide: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19504-01/802-6389/802-6389.pdf
- Common Desktop Environment: Programmer's Overview (high-level intro): https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19504-01/802-6487/802-6487.pdf

Many of these O'Reilly classics (like Xlib and Motif volumes) were made freely available years ago. If you're working on retro X11/Motif apps or maintaining old UNIX/CDE code, these are the go-to books.

For more, check Internet Archive (search for "Xlib Programming Manual Nye" or "Motif Programming Manual Heller") or the X.Org programming documentation page: https://www.x.org/wiki/ProgrammingDocumentation — it links to several archived PDFs.
