## CK-Calc Scientific Mode TODO

- [x] Add View menu separator and radio buttons for modes (“Basic”, “Scientific”).
- [x] Persist mode selection: save/load via config (like thousand separators) and session data.
- [x] Refactor keypad layout creation into a rebuild function that can switch between basic and scientific.
- [x] For Scientific mode, extend keypad with 6 extra columns of dummy “?” buttons to the left; update window width accordingly.
- [x] Ensure keyboard focus and shortcuts continue to work after layout rebuild.
- [x] Restore/switch layout correctly on startup based on saved mode.
